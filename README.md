# Dedicated Worker Demo

## Try it out
```
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Dedicated Workers
Dedicated Web Workers allow you to delegate some work to **a separate thread** instead of the main thread. This allows us to run JavaScript code **multi-threaded.**

This is useful when you have a computationally heavy task which you want to run. Normally you would run this on the main thread, **but there it can actually block the UI** (as this also lives on the main thread). Delegating heavy duty work to another thread allows the user to use an app **without being interrupted.**

## Conclusion
It is rather straight-forward to delegate some work to a Worker. By spawning multiple concurrent workers it's possible to get more work done than was possible on the main thread. An ugly side-effect of running heavy tasks on the main thread is that it locks up the UI from being rendered until the work was finished. So the main benefits are:

> âœ… Better user experience (app still reacts to user input)

> âœ… You can truly run concurrent tasks (on multiple threads)

> âœ… It's fully supported! https://caniuse.com/#search=web%20worker

> ðŸš« A Worker cannot directly access DOM, all work needs to be messaged back to the caller on the main thread, and this requires some management.
